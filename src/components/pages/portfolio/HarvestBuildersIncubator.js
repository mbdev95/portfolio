      <p>
        I completed a six week incubator program put on by Harvest Builders. The
        program involved learning the tech stack used by Neo Financial by coding
        a full stack pizza delivery application. As a result, I had to quickly
        self-learn and expand on already familiar technologies such as GraphQL,
        TypeScript and Jest. All the code contained unit tests to ensure
        quality. Unfortunately, this repository is private so the code is not
        viewable.
