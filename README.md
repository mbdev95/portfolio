# Portfolio
My personal portfolio website was created using a combination of React and SCSS to create sliding pages and a series of animations.  I used react router for navigation.  Context was used to easily share information throughout my application. My goal of the portfolio website was to improve upon and implement my knowledge of front-end web development while displaying my various other projects.
